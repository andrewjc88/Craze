# Mobile App Landing Page (FRONT-END DEV CODE CHALLENGE)
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
As a member of the web front-end team of a mobile app company you've been tasked with the development of a new,
re-designed, landing page. The creative team is providing the ​PSD file​ with the design spec that you should follow. 
## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
You are free to use the tools, libraries or frameworks of your choice ​(except for the carousel component)​. The PSD template doesn't contain the final copy, only placeholders. You're free to use additional placeholder copy and assets if necessary.
Even though the PSD template only illustrates the desktop/tablet version of the page, you're expected to produce a mobile responsive implementation.
The page is pretty much static, except for the carousel with the product testimonials. You must use ​your own implementation​ for the carousel according to these specs:
- Animate slide transition
- Slides should auto rotate after 4 seconds
- User should be able to navigate between slides
- Auto rotate should be disabled once user has interacted
The code delivered should contain a script that builds the project. You are free to use any package manager or task runner (bower, npm grunt, gulp, etc).
## DELIVERABLES
The repository should contain all files needed to generate the landing page. A build script should be available in order to generate a production-ready page. The code should be available in GitHub. 

Here are the steps you should follow: 
1. Create a public repository on GitHub (create an account if you don't have one).
2. Create a branch and commit the code to it. Do not push the code to the master branch.
3. Include in the same repository one or more screenshots. Include a README file with instructions on how to run any provided build script.
4. Once the work is complete, create a pull request (leave it open, do not merge it into master), and send us the link to it.
